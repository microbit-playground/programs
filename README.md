###### A Brief Note
Github is very rude! I do not mean the people but github.com.  Picture the scene: you spend an age writing an article and are filled with pride and goodness about helping kids & adults learn. When I review and start to edit it, __rejected__ or __changes requested__ appears!

Perhaps this works fine in some areas but I know there is an emotional attachment when writing learning resources.

So please, do please translate these message from robot into Human.

### Files in Repository
The website's pages are generated from `.md` files in the main directory. The name of each `.md` file has a corresponding image in `/teaser/` of the same name.

* `/images/` -- Images used in the article.
* `/teaser/` -- Directory for teaser images & video.
* `/teaser/tiny` & `/teaser/card` -- Generated images sizes.
* `/KITCHENSINK.md` -- Examples for fomatting.
